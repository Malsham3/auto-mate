<alt-h1>Introduction

Our assigment was to _"conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests."_. Further, we were given the following criteria to meet:

> 1. Must use at least two server-side APIs,  
_We used APIs from the NHTSA and Unsplash_
> 2. Must use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap,  
_For this project, we collectively studied and taught ourselves the basics of Bulma_
> 3. Use at least one new third-party API,  
_Criteria satisfied by the use of the NHTSA API_
> 4. Must have a polished, mobile-first UI,  
_Speaking as modestly as possible being one of the contributors, we killed it._
> 5. Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, naming, scoping, etc.),  
_We utilized various formatters to polish the look of the code, as well as our best use of common sense to make the look, flow of the code, and naming as clear and clean as possible._
> 6. Does NOT use alerts, confirms, or prompts,  
_This could have been satisfied by the use of a modal, which we experimented with at the beginning of the project, but we did not need it._
> 7. Must be deployed using GitHub Pages  
_Please visit our app here and maybe find the car of your dreams, [Auto Mate](https://malsham3.github.io/auto-mate). Also, please feel free to visit Mostafa's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Malsham3/auto-mate) from where we worked._
> 8. Must be interactive (i.e.: accept and respond to user input)  
_Satisfied by the user's ability to enter VIN and year info and have vehicle specs returned._

After a brief brainstorming session, our team decided to focus on developing an application that would compare vehilce specs by entering pertinent information. Many of our ideas hit a pay-wall as we encountered several pay-to-use APIs. Our solution was to generate inputs where the user enters a vehicle's VIN and model year, returning pertinent specs. Also, the user can enter two separate VINs and the correct model years respectively and have both data sets displayed in the table towards the bottom of our page.

After deciding on our concept, Jacob mocked up the image below. Our final site stayed very true this early idea.

We then divded into two teams. On the back-end, Bradley and Mostafa breathed life into Auto Mate's Javascript, making the application funtional; both in receiving the user input then responding with corresponding vehicle specs. Our front-end team consisted of Jacob and Pablo, making the site
aesthetically pleasing, responsive, and user-friendly.

#Results

Our team is very satisfied with the application we developed. Auto Mate effectively retrieves and displays vehicle specs based on a user's input, has a simple and intuitive user interface, and a fun and clean appearance. Below is an image of the main section of Auto Mate. Here you can see two Bulma styled tiles for the two vehicles and a table that auto-populates based on the user's input.
